### Introduction

My name is Imran, and I am a dedicated Laravel and Python developer.
My journey into the world of programming and development has been both challenging and rewarding, marked by a passion for technology and a commitment to continuous learning.


### Early Life and Education

From a young age, I was fascinated by computers and how they work. This curiosity led me to explore various aspects of technology and eventually sparked my interest in programming. 
Despite my enthusiasm and dedication, my formal educational journey was not as smooth as I had hoped. I completed my intermediate studies but was unable to pursue a bachelor's degree due to low marks. 
This setback, however, did not deter me from my goals. Instead, it fueled my determination to prove that academic scores do not define one's potential or capability.
